# GraphQL with React JS Course

This repository contains the code that I'm implementing throughout the course.

* 16/10/2019 - At this point I learned to build schemas, query from a hard-coded data storage, make relationships between schemas and query data from an API server.
* 17/10/2019 - I learned to create mutations that manipulate a resource and return the data.
